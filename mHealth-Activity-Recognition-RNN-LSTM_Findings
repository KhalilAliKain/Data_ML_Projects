The RNN model achieved moderate training accuracy (70-80%) but exhibited overfitting, with validation accuracy dropping to 40-50%. The ReLU activation function 
improved accuracy over Softmax. Conversely, the LSTM model performed better, showing training accuracy of 79-86% and validation accuracy of 77-83%, 
indicating better generalization. LSTMâ€™s architecture allowed it to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making it more effective for 
activity classification using temporal mHealth data.
